### 🧬 Hello there! 🧬

My repository contains:
- 🌞 Code I've written as a Research associate 
- 🌚 Personal projects I've worked on in my own time
 
I like making things that are fun for my friends, and I'm currently interested in just learning more about coding. So a lot of what you find in here no doubt has room to improve. 

Thanks for browsing, and as usual:
